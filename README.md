## 2. What are some strategies to tailor your content to different audience types?
For Tech Experts: Include advanced features, technical specifications, and use industry terminology. Focus on the "why" behind decisions and the implications of technical details.
For Non-Experts: Break down information into simple concepts, use analogies, and provide step-by-step explanations. Avoid overwhelming them with details and focus on practical, relatable examples.
## 3. How can you gauge the existing knowledge of your audience to avoid overwhelming them with jargonSurveys and Feedback: Ask your audience directly about their knowledge level before presenting.
